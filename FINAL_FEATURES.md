# Dynamic Maze Solver - Final Feature List

## üéØ **Complete Feature Summary**

### ‚úÖ **Core Features**

#### 1. **Beautiful Click-Based UI**
- Main menu with controls and game info panels
- Mode selection screen (MANUAL vs AUTO)
- Level selection screen (5 difficulty levels)
- All text rendered using OpenGL primitives (no font dependencies)
- Visible button labels: START, MANUAL, AUTO, LEVEL 1-5

#### 2. **Two Game Modes**

**MANUAL MODE:**
- Click obstacles to toggle them on/off during gameplay
- Full control over maze environment
- Path recalculates with 200ms debounce (smooth, no lag)
- Great for testing specific scenarios

**AUTO MODE (NEW & IMPROVED!):**
- **Movement:** You still press ENTER to move (not automatic!)
- **Smart Obstacles:** After each move, obstacles are intelligently placed:
  - Targets the planned path ahead of the agent
  - Places 1-3 obstacles ON or NEAR the blue path line
  - Forces Dynamic A* to recalculate around new obstacles
  - **Perfect for demonstrating Dynamic A* replanning!**
- Console shows: "Added obstacle at (x,y) blocking path!"
- Watch the blue path line change in real-time as it adapts

#### 3. **Progressive Difficulty (5 Levels)**
1. **EASY** - 10x10 Grid, 10% obstacles
2. **MEDIUM** - 15x15 Grid, 15% obstacles  
3. **HARD** - 20x20 Grid, 20% obstacles
4. **VERY HARD** - 25x25 Grid, 25% obstacles
5. **EXPERT** - 30x30 Grid, 30% obstacles

#### 4. **Level Progression**
- Complete a level by reaching the red goal
- Press **N** to advance to next level
- Returns to mode selection for the next level
- Play through all 5 levels progressively

#### 5. **Visual Feedback**
- üü¢ **Green** = Start position
- üî¥ **Red** = Goal position
- üîµ **Blue line** = Optimal path (recalculates in real-time)
- üü° **Yellow circle** = Your agent
- ‚ö´ **Black cells** = Obstacles
- ‚ö™ **White cells** = Walkable areas

## üéÆ **How to Play**

### Getting Started:
1. **Run MazeSolver.exe**
2. **Click START** button on main menu
3. **Click MANUAL or AUTO** mode
4. **Click a level** (1-5) to begin

### During Gameplay:
1. **Click** on grid to select START (green)
2. **Click** on grid to select GOAL (red)
3. **Press ENTER** to move one step along the blue path
4. **In Manual Mode:** Click cells to toggle obstacles
5. **In Auto Mode:** Obstacles auto-place after each ENTER press
6. Watch the path recalculate around new obstacles!

### After Completing a Level:
- **Press N** - Go to next level
- **Press R** - Return to main menu

## üß† **Dynamic A* Demonstration**

### Perfect for AI Lab Demonstrations:

#### **Why Auto Mode is Ideal:**
1. **Shows Adaptive Pathfinding:**
   - Each time you press ENTER, new obstacles block the planned path
   - Dynamic A* immediately recalculates a new route
   - Blue path line updates in real-time

2. **Visual Learning:**
   - See obstacles appear on the path ahead
   - Watch the agent adapt to changing environment
   - Console shows exactly where obstacles are placed

3. **Console Output Example:**
   ```
   [AUTO mode: Attempting to block path with 2 obstacles]
     ‚Üí Added obstacle at (5,8) blocking path!
     ‚Üí Added obstacle at (6,9) blocking path!
     ‚ö° Path blocked! Dynamic A* will recalculate...
   Agent: Path repaired successfully
   Agent: Moved to (4,7) [12 steps remaining]
   ```

4. **Key Differences from Static A*:**
   - **Static A\*:** Plan once, execute path
   - **Dynamic A\* (D* Lite):** Replans efficiently when obstacles change
   - Auto mode forces replanning every step = perfect demonstration!

## üéØ **Controls Reference**

### Mouse Controls:
- **Click buttons** - Navigate menus
- **Click grid cells** - Select start/goal or toggle obstacles (manual mode)

### Keyboard Controls:
- **ENTER** - Move agent one step
- **N** - Next level (after completing current level)
- **R** - Reset to main menu
- **A** - Switch to A* algorithm
- **D** - Switch to Dynamic A* algorithm
- **ESC** - Quit application

## üöÄ **Technical Highlights**

### Optimizations:
- **Debounced path recalculation** (200ms delay) = no lag when clicking obstacles
- **VSync enabled** = smooth 30 FPS rendering
- **Render-on-demand** = efficient CPU usage
- **OpenGL text rendering** = works on all systems, no font issues

### Algorithms:
- **A\*:** Classic optimal pathfinding with Manhattan heuristic
- **Dynamic A\* (D* Lite):** Efficient replanning for dynamic environments
- Both guarantee shortest path

### Smart Obstacle Placement (Auto Mode):
```cpp
// Targets points ahead on the planned path
pathIndex = (rand() % (currentPath.size() - 2)) + 2;
targetPos = currentPath[pathIndex];

// Also considers adjacent cells
blockPos = targetPos + offset;
```

## üìä **Use Cases**

### For Demonstrations:
1. **Show Static A\*:** Use Manual mode, no obstacles during movement
2. **Show Dynamic A\*:** Use Auto mode, obstacles block path repeatedly
3. **Compare Algorithms:** Switch between A* and D* Lite mid-game

### For Learning:
- Understand how pathfinding adapts to changing environments
- See the difference between planning and replanning
- Visual representation of graph search algorithms

### For Fun:
- Challenge yourself through 5 difficulty levels
- Manual mode = strategic puzzle
- Auto mode = race against changing maze

## üèÜ **Perfect for Lab Presentation**

**Talking Points:**
1. "In Manual mode, I can place obstacles to test pathfinding"
2. "In Auto mode, watch how Dynamic A* adapts when obstacles block the path"
3. "Notice the blue line (path) recalculates in real-time"
4. "This demonstrates the key advantage of D* Lite over static A*"
5. "The algorithm can replan efficiently without starting from scratch"

**Demo Flow:**
